This directory contains the class WMABridgeAPIExample and scripts to build
and run it.

WMABridgAPIExample.java is a J2SE program that uses the Wireless Toolkit's 
WMA Bridge API to send and receive SMS and CBS messages to and from emulators
in the toolkit environment. You can use the WMABridgeAPIExample class as an 
example for how to integrate your own J2SE programs into the Wireless Toolkit's
messaging environment.

Two scripts (buildExample and runBridgeAPIExample) are provided to build the
program and run it.

To run the demo you should ensure that the runBridgeAPIExample script  
(.bat or .sh) properly sets the "kvem.home" property to the
directory containing the Wireless Toolkit. By default the script points to
the directory where the Wireless Toolkit was installed.
